# in-class-assign-2

# I made, or at least attempted 3 versions of this.  Only one works though

## Version 1: This one works, but you have to actually edit the value of n in the code

## version 2: This one I tried using input with it, but it doesn't work 

## version 3: In this one I tried making a function but really didn't understand how to make it work

I ended up running out of time so couldn't play around with them any longer.
